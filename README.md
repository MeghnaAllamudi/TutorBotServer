Tutoring Server:
This code basically starts up a server that up to 100 clients can connect to and creates a protocol for a TUTORBOT to help the user find people to connect to. Once a person has connected to someone else, a private connection is established and no one else on the server will be able to listen in on their conversation.
To start this up, all you need is an IDE that supports Java and start by running “ServerTest.java” and, once that is running, and a GUI pops up, you can then create how many ever clients you want by repeatedly clicking run on the “ClientTest.java” file.
DISCLAIMER: Because I didn’t build the Bot using NLP or something along those lines, it needs to accept exact strings like “Math”, “History”, etc. for subjects and “s” and “t” for identity, and the exact tutor name of the tutor you have selected from the list.
As for the demo videos, I put two in because I forgot to explain one very quick thing in the first one, but that second video is only 2 minutes long.
